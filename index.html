                <p>What began as a simple resource list for our holistic therapy, coaching, and energy healing practice
                    has evolved into a growing, dynamic hub for learning, reflection, and connection.</p>
                <p>Here, you'll find curated tools, articles, and links that reflect our values: mental health access,
                    body liberation, disability justice, queer inclusion, intersectionality, and collective care.</p>
                <p>We created this space not just to support our clients, but to contribute to broader conversations
                    about wellness, equity, and healing.</p>
                <p>Special thanks to Ashantis Jones, whose vision, time, and expertise helped bring this project to
                    life. Their contributions were foundational in shaping this as a space that honors both lived
                    experience and professional insight.</p>
                <p>We hope you find something here that affirms, inspires, or supports you - and we invite you to return
                    often, share widely, and be part of this evolving conversation.</p>
