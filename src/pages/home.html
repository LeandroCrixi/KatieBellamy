        <p>What began as a simple resource list for our holistic therapy, coaching, and energy healing practice
            has evolved into a growing, dynamic hub for learning, reflection, and connection.</p>
        <p>Here, you'll find curated tools, articles, and links that reflect our values: mental health access,
            body liberation, disability justice, queer inclusion, intersectionality, and collective care.</p>
        <p>We created this space not just to support our clients, but to contribute to broader conversations
            about wellness, equity, and healing.</p>
        <p>Special thanks to <span><a class="text-color-4" href="https://www.katie-bellamy.com/about-ashantis">Ashantis Jones</a></span>, 
            whose vision, time, and expertise helped bring this project to
            life. Their contributions were foundational in shaping this as a space that honors both lived
            experience and professional insight.</p>
        <p>We hope you find something here that affirms, inspires, or supports you - and we invite you to return
            often, share widely, and be part of this evolving conversation.</p>
